High-Level Synthesis (HLS) has emerged as a key methodology for bridging the gap between software design and hardware implementation. Among various optimization strategies, Coarse-Grained Pipeline Architecture (CGPA) has shown promise in improving throughput by partitioning programs into pipeline stages. However, achieving effective parallelism remains challenging due to control and data dependencies. This work investigates the integration of Program Slicing-based Decoupled Software Pipelining (PS-DSWP) into CGPA to improve stage-level parallelism and performance. By applying program slicing techniques prior to software pipelining, the proposed approach enhances the decoupling of stages and reduces inter-stage communication overhead. Experimental results on representative benchmarks demonstrate notable improvements in resource utilization and latency reduction compared to baseline CGPA implementations. This study highlights the potential of PS-DSWP as a complementary technique for advancing pipeline-based HLS designs.
