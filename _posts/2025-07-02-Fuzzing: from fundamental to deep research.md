This talk explores the landscape of modern fuzzingâ€”a well-proven, automated testing technique for assessing program robustness by providing invalid, unexpected, and random inputs. As a fundamental technique in system security, its application in contemporary research is crucial. To illustrate the journey from fundamental concepts to advanced application, the presentation will dive into the detailed analysis of ReUSB and Moneta, two of presenter's recent works on fuzzing. These publications demonstrate how novel fuzzing techniques are integrated into system security research to uncover critical vulnerabilities.
