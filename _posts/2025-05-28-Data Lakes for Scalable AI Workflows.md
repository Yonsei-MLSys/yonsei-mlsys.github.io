Data lakes were introduced to overcome the limitations of traditional data warehouses, especially in handling large and diverse datasets. They support schema-on-read and decoupled storage and compute, which are useful for modern data processing. This session introduces how data lakes have evolved in terms of architecture and system design. Their applications in AI workflows—such as data preparation, feature extraction, and model training—are also discussed. The session further addresses key challenges including metadata management, data quality, and query performance, and examines how AI techniques can be applied to improve the efficiency and automation of data lake operations.
