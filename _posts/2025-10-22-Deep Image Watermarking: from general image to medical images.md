Recently, deep learning-based image watermarking techniques have been actively studied in various applications such as image copyright protection, data integrity verification, and information security. In the medical imaging domain, the importance of watermarking has been increasing as a technical means to simultaneously ensure patient information protection and data traceability. This presentation explores deep learning-based watermarking methods originally developed for general images and discusses their extension to medical imaging, particularly in synthetic medical image environments.
