With the rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) and increasing industry adoption, organizations are exploring how to seamlessly integrate ML with their existing data and systems. As ML applications expand, a critical challenge arises: how can organizations leverage their well-established data infrastructure to support ML workflows effectively? This talk explores the intersection of ML and data management, focusing on how ML pipelines—from training to inference and deployment—can be optimized from a data-centric perspective. Additionally, we will discuss how data management systems can better support ML-driven applications, particularly in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and highlight ongoing research in this domain.
