Recent advances in large language models have enabled code agents to perform complex tasks through interaction with environments. Yet their effectiveness remains limited by challenges across the core capabilities of perception, reasoning, action, and learning, as well as their evaluation. This invited talk investigates five challenges associated with these areas—information deficiency, shallow reasoning, budget inefficiency, supervision failure, and diversity failure—and introduces targeted methods to address them.
