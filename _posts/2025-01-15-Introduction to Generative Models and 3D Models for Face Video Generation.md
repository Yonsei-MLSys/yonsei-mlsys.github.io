This presentation introduces the theories and models for face video generation and manipulation. The study has always been a imporant area in computer vision research. Consequently, new theories of generative models such as Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Flow-based Models, Diffusion Models, and Flow-matching-based Models have often been first applied and utilized in the face domain. Additionally, significant advancements have been made in leveraging explicit and implicit 3D models like the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting. This presentation will explore how these research approaches have been applied thus far and discuss their potential future developments.
