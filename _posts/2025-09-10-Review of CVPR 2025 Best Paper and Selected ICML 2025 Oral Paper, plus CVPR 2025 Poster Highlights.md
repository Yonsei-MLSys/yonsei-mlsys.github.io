In this presentation, I will provide a brief introduction to the background of 3D vision and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), followed by a review of two recent notable papers: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (CVPR 2025 Best Paper) and Concept Attention (ICML 2025 Oral Paper).
Additionally, I will give a rapid overview of selected posters from CVPR 2025, with a particular focus on emerging trends in medical imaging and various video-related tasks, based on my personal observations at the conference.
