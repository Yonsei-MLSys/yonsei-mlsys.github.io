This presentation introduces the company projects and research endeavors led by Kyobin Choo, highlighting key challenges encountered while developing a positron emission tomography (PET) quantification solution for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. These challenges naturally expanded into broader research in medical imaging, encompassing diverse computer vision tasks such as volumetric image segmentation, deformable image registration, denoising, and cross-modality image synthesis. In particular, this talk explores how diffusion models have been effectively leveraged to address medical image-specific challenges—distinct from those found in natural images—within generative tasks such as image-to-image translation.
