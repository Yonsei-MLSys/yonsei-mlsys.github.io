In this presentation, Sejong Yang shares his journey toward character talking head generation. The first part introduces his life experiences and the motivations that led him to pursue this topic as his PhD goal. He also presents four related research projects, offering insights into recent trends and studies in face modeling and talking head generation. Although still a work in progress, this slide deck—also used in his recent job talks—illustrates his ongoing efforts to extend talking head video generation beyond humans to encompass a wide range of characters throughout his PhD journey.
