<h5>

</h5>

This talk will explore the theoretical properties of discrete diffusion models and their application to language modeling. While diffusion models have achieved notable success in continuous domains like image and video generation, their application to discrete data, such as text, presents unique challenges. I'll begin with a brief introduction to the principles of discrete diffusion. Then, I'll delve into its fundamental theoretical properties and discuss key research topics and open problems specific to its use in language modeling.
