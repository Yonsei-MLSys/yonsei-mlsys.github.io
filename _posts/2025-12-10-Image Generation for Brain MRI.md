This presentation explores recent advances in image generation techniques for brain MRI, focusing on how generative models can enhance structural fidelity and support downstream clinical tasks. By leveraging representation learning and controllable synthesis, these approaches address core challenges such as data scarcity, anisotropic resolution, and the need for anatomically coherent image manipulation. Together, they demonstrate how modern generation frameworks can bridge the gap between technical image reconstruction and practical clinical utility. The talk will highlight extensive principles, shared insights, and future directions for brain MRI generation.
