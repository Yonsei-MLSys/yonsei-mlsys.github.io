The recently proposed racetrack architecture based on trapped-ion qubits by Quantinuum, and the zoned architecture using Rydberg atoms by QuEra, have hardware characteristics that differ  from conventional superconducting-based architectures with static topologies. These qubit systems, controlled by optical lasers, offer flexible connectivity for entangling operations, but they also introduce a new compilation challenge of shuttling overhead. In such systems, ions or neutral atoms should physically move to designated gate operation zones, adding a new layer of complexity for the qubit re-alignment.  In this presentation, we explore compilation methodologies to design variational quantum programs for quantum machine learning applications to be effectively trained on these emerging architectures.
