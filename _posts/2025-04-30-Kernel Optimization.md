Recent deep learning models consist of tens of thousands of GPU kernels. 
While early optimization efforts primarily focused on computation itself, advancements in both hardware and software have made non-computational overheads increasingly prominent. 
In this talk, we discuss the impact of such overheads on real-world models and explores optimization strategies to mitigate them, with a particular focus on kernel launch overhead.
