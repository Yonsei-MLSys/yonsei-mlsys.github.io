This presentation introduces the fundamental concepts and principles of quantum computing, including qubits, superposition, interference, and entanglement. It outlines the computational features of representative algorithms such as Grover’s search and Shor’s factorization, highlighting their advantages for specific structured problems. The limitations of current quantum hardware—noise, decoherence, and error correction overhead—are discussed alongside common misconceptions about speed, cryptography, and commercialization. Finally, the talk presents Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), especially lattice-based approaches, as a realistic response to future quantum threats. The goal is to clarify scientific facts and provide a balanced understanding of the current state and outlook of quantum computing.
