This presentation provides a concise introduction to compiler optimization and the importance of Intermediate Representation (IR) in supporting various hardware and software platforms. It explores applications in areas such as graph processing, homomorphic encryption, and deep learning, demonstrating how optimization techniques can enhance performance. To address memory bottlenecks, the concept of Processing In Memory (PIM) technology is introduced, with a focus on DRAM-based PIM hardware. The presentation outlines the design of PIM-friendly IR and its integration into compilers as a cohesive strategy for improving efficiency in memory-intensive tasks.
