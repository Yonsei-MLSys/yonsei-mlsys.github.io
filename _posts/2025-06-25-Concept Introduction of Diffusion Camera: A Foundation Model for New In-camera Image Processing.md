Traditional Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipelines use fixed algorithms, which makes them less adaptable to different imaging situations and user tastes. While deep learning has improved individual ISP modules, a comprehensive and flexible solution is still needed. Diffusion models show great promise in generating, enhancing, and restoring images. This research looks into whether a diffusion-based model could replace conventional ISP to create a unified and adaptive imaging system. Our proposed Diffusion Camera is a new framework that combines ISP processing and image editing into one diffusion-based model. This approach moves beyond traditional ISPs by unifying multiple tasks and allowing for personalization.
