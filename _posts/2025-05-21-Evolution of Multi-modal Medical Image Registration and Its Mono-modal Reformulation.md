Image registration is the task of aligning two images by establishing meaningful spatial correspondences between them. It plays a vital role in a wide range of applications, including computer vision, remote sensing, and especially medical imaging, where it is essential for tasks such as longitudinal studies, multi-modal image fusion, and image-guided interventions.
This seminar provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of deformable image registration, covering classical optimization-based methods as well as more recent deep learning approaches. A particular focus is placed on the technical challenges of multi-modal medical image registration, where aligning images from different modalities (e.g., MRI and CT) poses significant difficulties due to modality-specific appearance discrepancies.
The seminar concludes by introducing a recent approach that reformulates the multi-modal registration problem as a mono-modal one, enabling more robust and efficient optimization. This section will present my own research contributions in this direction.
