This presentation explores the evolution of photography and outlines the essential attributes of the “next-generation camera,” focusing on clarity, aesthetics, and personalization. We introduce two novel research contributions submitted to CVPR 2026 that leverage generative AI to address current limitations in computational photography. First, we present “LIIFusion,” a coarse-to-fine framework for Generative Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) that utilizes Implicit Neural Representations to achieve high-fidelity HDR imaging with significantly faster inference speeds than previous methods. Second, we propose a foundational approach to “Personalized Photographic Style,” addressing the subjectivity of aesthetics by introducing a large-scale dataset (PPSD) containing over 60,000 pairwise user preferences. We also demonstrate baseline models for learning individual styles and a new evaluation metric, the Comparative Quality Score (CQS), which balances prediction fidelity with preference alignment. Finally, the session discusses the future of AI-driven photography and the balance between automation and user agency in creating a “good” visual experience.
