This talk covers post-training techniques aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Key topics include foundational reinforcement learning methodologies as well as advanced approaches such as PPO, DPO, GRPO, and DAPO. We analyze how these methods affect model reasoning performance and response consistency. Furthermore, we discuss the effectiveness and limitations of each technique through representative evaluation benchmarks and experimental results, offering insights into future research directions.
