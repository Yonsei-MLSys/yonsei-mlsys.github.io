Modern large language models are not powered by algorithms alone—their performance and scalability depend on the entire system stack beneath them. From frameworks and compilers to runtime scheduling, hardware architecture, and network topology, each layer shapes efficiency, cost, and research velocity.
This talk explores how these layers interact to support training and serving at scale, and why system‑level understanding is essential for pushing the boundaries of modern ML. Attendees will gain a clear view of the system stack and practical insights on how to optimize it for real‑world deployments.
