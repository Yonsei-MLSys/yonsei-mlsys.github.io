We’d love to have you join us for a light, fast-paced recap of the highlights from Yonsei MLSys.
Each speaker will give a quick five-minute overview, and we’ll wrap up with an open Q&A to chat through your questions. 
If you’re hoping to go beyond reading papers and actually try things out, this meetup will offer hands-on exercises and a casual space to share ideas with other students and researchers. 
Come join us for a relaxed and engaging session!
