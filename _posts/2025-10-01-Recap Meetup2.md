We invite you to join us for an engaging yet concise recap of the standout sessions from Yonsei MLSys. We’ll cover compiler optimizations that speed up large-scale model training, dive into kernel-fusion strategies, and explore hardware-aware scheduling techniques illustrated with real-world case studies. You’ll also get a quick live demo for system optimization, plus practical tips for GPU and NPU profiling and tuning.

Each presenter will deliver a focused five-minute overview, followed by an open Q&A panel to tackle your questions. If you’re looking to move beyond paper reading, this meetup offers hands-on exercises and the chance to swap ideas with fellow students and researchers. Please join us for a collaborative and insightful session!
