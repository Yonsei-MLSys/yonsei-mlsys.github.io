<h5>

In this presentation, Jisoo Jang shares his research notes from the past year. This research began by analyzing the limitations of Moneta  to improve ex-vivo GPU driver fuzzing. Focusing specifically on the NVIDIA GPU driver, this talk analyzes how the GSP firmware hinders ex-vivo fuzzing . It then describes several attempted mitigation techniques, including optimizing snapshot creation , snapshot-aware emulation , and GPU-in-the-Loop . Finally, based on a comparison with in-vivo fuzzing , the presentation concludes that in-vivo fuzzing is the most promising path forward.
