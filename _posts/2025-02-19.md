In this seminar, I will share my journey through computer vision research, from early explorations to recent developments. Starting with my first steps into video instance segmentation during my 2020 internship, I will walk through key milestones: my first ICCV paper in 2021, my experience with workshops, and the path to my first co-first author paper at CVPR 2022. I will also discuss my research on object-centric learning, which led to another CVPR paper in 2023, and my latest work on an object-centric dataset. Through these experiences, I will reflect on how each project began, the challenges faced, and the insights gained along the way.
