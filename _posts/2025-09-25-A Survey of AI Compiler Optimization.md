title: "A Survey of AI Compiler Optimization"

<h5>

This talk surveys how modern AI compilers optimize deep-learning workloads, starting from a comparison between PyTorch’s eager execution and graph mode and how each affects dispatch, fusion, and specialization.
Graph capture is highlighted as a key enabler for global optimizations that are difficult in purely eager environments.
The rising interest in domain-specific languages (DSLs) for tensor computation is then introduced.
Major DSL, including Triton, Helion, and Cute DSL, are outlined.
The talk concludes with a summary of the optimizations each DSL family aims to automate, including fusion, tiling, memory scheduling, layout transformations, and hardware-specialized kernel generation.
